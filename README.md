# Soft Drink Demand Forecasting

This project was completed as part of my coursework in Business Analytics and Insights at Humber College.

## Project Description

In this project, I performed time series forecasting on weekly soft drink demand data. The project explored multiple forecasting models to predict future sales and optimize business decision-making.

The models applied include:
- ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
- ETS (Exponential Smoothing with Trend)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)

## My Work

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Building and tuning time series forecasting models
- Evaluating model performance using MAD and RMSE
- Visualizing forecasts and comparing model outputs
- Summarizing business insights and recommendations

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, TensorFlow, Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook
